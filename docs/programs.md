# Programs

Programs are assigned to, or selected by users. For each program we specify
the activity level it is suitable for and whether or not it is intended for users
over 60.

## Creating programs

To create a program select **Programs** from the sidebar, click **Create**, fill
in the form and hit **Save**.
