# Phases

Phases are used to group a week or more of [tasks](./tasks.md). The names of
phases will be presented to users as they progress through their programs. To
provide users with more information about a phase we can create a
[guide](./guides.md) and attach that to the phase.

## Creating phases

To create a phase select **Phases** from the sidebar, click **Create**, fill
in the form and hit **Save**.
