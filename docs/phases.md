# Phases

Phases are used to group a week or more of [tasks](./tasks.md).

The names of phases will be presented to the user as they progress through their
program. It is also possible to create [guides](./guides.md) and attach these to
specific phases.

## Creating phases

To create a phase select **Phases** from the sidebar, fill in the form and hit
**Save**.
