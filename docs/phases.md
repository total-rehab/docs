# Phases

Phases are used to group a week or more of [tasks](./tasks.md). The names of
phases will be presented to the user as they progress through their program. To
the user with more information about a phase we can create a [guide](./guides.md)
and attach that to a specific phase.

## Creating phases

To create a phase select **Phases** from the sidebar, fill in the form and hit
**Save**.
