# Guides

Guides are presented on the schedule screen and used to provide additional
information to the user, as they work through their program. They can be attached to specific phases programs, or some combination
of the two,

For example, you might want to attach a guide about the P.R.I.C.E protocol to the “Swelling and Support” phase of all programs. In this case you would select this phase from the dropdown and leave the programs empty.

If you wanted to show a guide throughout all phases of a program you would select the program from the dropdown and leave the phases empty.

If you wanted to show the guide only for a specific phase of a specific program you would select both the phase and the program in the dropdown.

Both the programs and phases dropdown accept multiple values, which may be useful if you have a guide that you want to show across specific combinations of phases and programs.
