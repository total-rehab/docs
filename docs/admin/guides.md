# Guides

Guides are presented on the schedule screen and used to provide additional
information to the user as they work through their program. Each guide can be
attached to one or more [programs](./programs.md), [phases](./phases.md), or
some combination of the two.

## Scenario

Let's say you wanted to write a guide about the P.R.I.C.E protocol and attach it
to the "Swelling and Support" phase of all programs. In this case you would
go to the **Guides** section in the admin, hit **Create**, write your guide
and select the "Swelling and Support" phase from the **Phases** dropdown. The
**Programs** dropdown would be left empty.

If you then decided you only wanted the guide to appear on particular programs
you would edit the guide and select those programs from the **Programs**
dropdown.

Both the programs and phases dropdown accept multiple values, so you could have
the same guide appear across two phases of two programs, for example.

:::tip
At least one program or phase must be selected for the guide to appear within
the app.
